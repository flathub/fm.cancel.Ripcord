  <description>
    <p>Ripcord is a desktop chat client for group-centric services like Slack and Discord. It provides a traditional compact desktop interface designed for power users. It's not built on top of web browser technology: it has a small resource footprint, responds quickly to input, and gets out of your way. Shareware is coming back, baby.</p>
    <p>Ripcord is developed independently, and is not affiliated with Slack or Discord.</p>

  <releases>
    <release version="0.4.29" date="2021-06-04">
      <description>
        <p>General:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added option to add extra highlighting to the active tab with an extra line of color (off by default.)</li>
          <li>Minor tweaks to the GUI style engine to make disabled widgets more distinct from enabled widgets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Slack:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed sign-in with username &amp; password no longer working.</li>
          <li>  Some stuff changed on Slack's servers. Now Ripcord has been updated to deal with it.</li>
          <li>Fixed file upload no longer working.</li>
          <li>  Same as above.</li>
          <li>Added per-message explicit timestamp in the right-click menu for messages.</li>
          <li>Increased per-workspace custom emoji limit from 100,000 to 1,000,000.</li>
          <li>Added a workaround for Apple rdar://12345 links being mangled due to URL parsing treating the 12345 part as an integer IP address.</li>
          <li>  This integer parsing is apparently the "correct" behavior for parsing URLs, but results in rdar://12345 links being useless in Ripcord.</li>
          <li>  Ripcord now has a workaround that will rewrite those URLs to rdar://problem/12345 when they're clicked on or copied to the clipboard. This prevents the the number part from being (correctly?) parsed as integer, and should still work with the rdar:// URL handlers.</li>
          <li>Added gemini:// as a whitelisted URL scheme.</li>
          <li>Added snrx:// as a whitelisted URL scheme.</li>
          <li>Note for Slack users: there is a known and unresolved issue where your channel sidebar may become cluttered with junk channels named like #mpdm-foo--bar. I know about this and I'm fixing it. The fix for it didn't make it into this version, 0.4.29, because a complete and flexible solution for it involves changing some code that will require heavy testing, and I didn't want to delay releasing an update any longer. Sorry about that.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Discord:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added a dedicated mute button for other users in voice chats. Finally.</li>
          <li>Added ability to bookmark group DM channels. Finally.</li>
          <li>Added support for replying to messages in DM and group DM channels.</li>
          <li>Added support for newer permissions flags, like "request to speak" for stage channels.</li>
          <li>Added a menu item and a toolbar button to join or start DM and group DM voice calls. The only way to do this previously was to right-click on the DM channel in the sidebar. That was stupid. Now there's a regular menu item and toolbar button.</li>
          <li>Added guild creation date in the right-click menu for guilds.</li>
          <li>Added channel creation date in the right-click menu for channels.</li>
          <li>Added anti-spam warning in the "accept invite" menu/dialog.</li>
          <li>Changed the URL used when clicking on the thumbnail of an uploaded video so that web browsers will prefer to play the video in a tab instead of download the video as a file to disk. Finally.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where angle brackets could be treated as Qt's pseudo-HTML text styling markers in the rich embed text sub-view. This was not an exploitable bug. It was caused by Qt's document layout system automatically trying to apply bold, italic, etc. styling if it thought the plain text had HTML-like tags in it.</li>
          <li>Fixed unsent input text being cleared when navigating from one Discord channel to another while quick reply input mode is engaged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Windows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reordered some initialization procedures to slightly reduce startup time.</li>
        </ul>
